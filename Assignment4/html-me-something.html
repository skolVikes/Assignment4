    <h1>Places I have lived.</h1>
    <h2>Ottumwa, Iowa</h2>
    
    <p>I was born and raised in a small town called Ottumwa. It had a population of around 25,000.
    Life there was fairly simple. Most people knew each other as there was only one highschool and one middle school. 
    I chose to leave because, like many small towns, career opportunities were few and far between. </p>
